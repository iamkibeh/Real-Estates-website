## Known Bugs

This website works and responds well with medium and large sized screens. Users with small sized screens for example mobile phones with smaller widths may find it difficult using the application but I am working on making the website accessible to any device. I am also looking forward to incorporating a database that would handle user input data and manage it to produce expected results.
